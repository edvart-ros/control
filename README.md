# Optimal_control
## control_allocation.py
uses cvxpy to allocate control to 4 rotatable thrusters on a surface vessel, to a ahieve a given total generalized force vector.

## plot_control_allocation.ipynb
plots the control allocation solutions in matplotlib with interactive sliders. Also implements an constrained psuedo-inverse solution as a solution to the optimal control allocation problem.
